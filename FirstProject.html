                <h2>Background Every Web Developer Needs to Know
                </h2>
                <h3>The Frenchman has overseen a notable improvement in La Liga and in Europe since the sacking of Benitez and Real's march to the Milan showpiece is vindication for Florentino Perez.
                </h3>       
                <p>MADRID, Spain -- The "Zidane effect" is a reality after all. The Frenchman took over at Real Madrid in January with no top-level coaching experience and initial impressions were mixed, but he has now led Los Blancos to the Champions League final. The gamble for Florentino Perez has well and truly paid off.</p>
                
                <h4>A Brief Technical Overview of the World Wide Web</h4>
                <p>The World Wide Web started out as a means for sharing scientific resources like research documentation between governmental and academic institutions.  It took time for the technologies and practices to evolve beyond its original purpose.</p>
                
                <p>In his first few weeks in charge, the players appeared happier and all spoke of how the team was more unified under Zidane. And Pepe even said that the Frenchman would go on to become one of the best coaches in the world.</p> 

                <p>However, there were ups and downs. Big wins at home early on in his reign were similar to results attained by Benitez, while Madrid struggled away and the loss to Atletico at the Santiago Bernabeu in late February raised serious doubts all over again.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="3092072_heroa.jpg" alt="A diagram of UEFA chamsp">
                    <figcaption>Zidane gamble becomes reality must be a Madrid dab in Milan says UEFA</figcaption>
                    </figure>  
                <p>Since then, though, he has shown that he is an upgrade on Rafa. The 2-1 win in the Clasico at Camp Nou was a big boost, ending Barcelona's 39-match unbeaten streak and also reopening the title race as the Catalans subsequently suffered a dip in form.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="3114402.jpg" width="612" height="420" alt="Pegrini and Zidane handshake">
                    <figcaption><a href="#">FULL STORY | Zidane's Madrid advance to Champions League final</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    On the pitch, Madrid has improved notably too. The vast spaces between midfield and attack seen in the first Clasico have been evident at times, but the team works much better now as a unit and even Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo have been tracking back and helping out defensively in the biggest games.</p>
                    
                <p>
                    So despite his lack of coaching experience, Zidane looks like the right man to take the club forward. And after hitting the winner to claim La Novena and assisting Carlo Ancelotti when Madrid won La Decima, he has a shot at bringing home La Undecima now<br><br>  

                    Rafa was never the right man, but Zizou is - and the "Zidane effect" is a reality after all.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>The atmosphere has improved and with it, the performances are better. Results have followed and even though Madrid may have peaked too late to win La Liga, it now has a shot at claiming the Champions League. And there was no way that would have happened under Rafa.</p>
                <h4>Back to Tutorial</h4>
                <h4>The Purpose for Standards Groups</h4>
                <p>
                    At every step of the way, one or more organizations were formed to help identify standards for these technologies comprised of experts and luminaries who were pushing these technologies forward.  They would meet both virtually and in person to define and discuss the merits of adding new features to a given standard and would encourage organizations who were creating hardware and software to follow these standards so that products from different vendors could work together seamlessly.  Perhaps one of the most influential and important standards body you will hear about is the W3C, or rather, the World Wide Web Consortium.  They were one of the groups responsible for the latest version of HTML, version 5.  Another is the WHATWG, or rather, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, which is comprised of a subset of the W3C and several additional experts and organizations that have a  vested interest in the vitality of the World Wide Web.  The background of HTML5, the previous versions of HTML, as well as the standards organizations involved is fascinating because you get a peek into both the process and the politics of these organizations.
                </p>
                <h4>Recap of the World Wide Web Technical Overview</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>First of all, hopefully you now have an answer to the question everyone first starting out asks: "why the heck did they make URLs so convoluted?  Wouldn't it be easier to just type in 'microsoft' instead of 'http://www.microsoft.com'?"  There's an evolution of technologies, and furthermore, it was never intended for use by the masses.  At some point commercialized and individual access to the internet dwarfed the intended use, however the technologies created 30 years ago are still in play.</li>
                    
                     <li>Second, hopefully you will begin see the purpose of things like http:// ... in which you are saying you want to access a specific channel of traffic, HTTP, or rather, World Wide Web traffic, as opposed to FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for working with large files, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending email, and so on.</li>
                     <li>Third, hopefully you see the purpose of .com, .edu, .net and so on ... at least, you understand the original purpose, and you understand how those domain names are translated into the actual IP Addresses that are utilized by routers to move traffic around the internet to it's intended destination.</li>
                     <li>Fourth, hopefully you can see that the specifics of HTML - and all other standards - are decided on by a body of individuals who understand what is needed and propose and debate the merits of adding or removing parts of a given specification.  You should also see the purpose for these standards - so that organizations creating hardware and software to support the World Wide Web can achieve a high degree of interoperability.</li>
                     <li>Fifth, hopefully you can see the role that each component plays in the exchange of documents and other resources ... the web browser is responsible for interacting with the end user who requests a document by typing in a web address or clicks on a hyperlink.  It also packages up that request and begins the process of requesting the document from it's host, the computer called the web server.  The message is packaged using the HTTP protocol, which you can think of as an electronic envelope geared towards stateless request / response style transmissions between two computers.  Routers are special devices that know how to interpret the address encoded in electronic envelopes, or rather, the HTTP messages, and route them closer to their ultimate destination.  A web server is merely a computer at a given web address that is listening for HTTP requests, and if the address is valid, returns the requested document or resource using the same HTTP message addressing as a response.</li>

                <h2>How Web Browsers Parse HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    One final topic I want to talk about that affects modern web development is the implementations of various web browsers.  As you'll recall, once the requested web page has been returned, it will be parsed by a web browser then displayed on screen.
                </p>
                <p>There are four major parsing and rendering engines that are popular today.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trident, the web browser engine from Internet Explorer, is used by many applications on the Microsoft Windows platform, such as netSmart, Outlook Express, some versions of Microsoft Outlook, and the mini-browsers in Winamp and RealPlayer.</li>
                    <li>KDE's open-source KHTML engine is used in KDE's Konqueror web browser and was the basis for WebKit, the rendering engine in Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome web browsers.</li>
                    <li>Gecko, the Mozilla project's open-source web browser engine, is used by a variety of products derived from the Mozilla code base, including the Firefox web browser, the Thunderbird e-mail client, and SeaMonkey internet suite.</li>
                    <li>Opera Software's proprietary Presto engine is licensed to a number of other software vendors, and is used in Opera's own web browser.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each web page should declare which standard it has promised to adhere to.  This is called a DOCTYPE, and it is the reason that we typed this:<br>
                <br>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                <br>
                <br>
                ... at the very top of our web page.  This instruction told any web browser that may open it that it should be evaluated as an HTML5 document, as opposed to an HTML document of another version.  Every instruction should adhere to the HTML5 specification (which we'll talk about in a moment).  If it doesn't, the renderer may not know how to properly apply the rules of HTML5 to the document and must drop back into something called "quirks mode" where the browser will take a best guess on how to best render the web page.  "Quirks mode" exists because there are plenty of poorly coded HTML page in the world and the web browser wants to try to the best of its ability to render something to the end user.  If web browsers through up their hands and complained each time a web developer wrote bad code, the World Wide Web experience would be dreadful.  Since writing HTML that doesn't validate against a standard can produce inconsistent results, web developers are strongly encouraged to take great care in the code they write.  In fact, most tools that allow you to write HTML pages incorporate a validator to ensure the code you write validates against your chosen HTML specification.  We'll use an HTML5 validator that's available on the internet for free in just a moment.</p>

                <p>Once the document has been parsed, the browser can begin the rendering process.  "Render" means that the code will be translated into visual elements on screen using algorithms and rules coded into the rendering engine, the components in the web browser responsible for this activity.  The rendering engine will figure out how much screen space is available, and will begin to dole out the screen real estate equitably to lay out the various parts of the page onto the computer screen.  There's much more to it than that, but again I'm just trying to speak at a very high level about what happens here.</p>
               
                <aside>If you have a captive audience, the experience is a little different.  For example, In Windows 8, HTML5 developers can rely on Internet Explorer 10's expanded HTML5 support to build user interfaces that run as Metro-style applications utilizing the WinRT API.  In this case, you know for a fact where your HTML5 will be rendered and by whom, and you are free to use the full set of HTML5 features IE10 supports without having to worry about other browser vendors and version.  Another example might be that someday you're building web-based intranet applications that will run inside of your enterprise on an Intranet.  In this case, your IT department may have standardized on a specific web browser.  If this is the case, you are free to use the HTML features supported by that specific vendor and version of web browser.</aside>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Hopefully you can see the issues surrounding HTML5 and CSS3 with regards to their support by various versions and vendors of web browsers and two different thought processes on how to incorporate HTML5 into your own work.</p>
